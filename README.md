# etch-a-sketch
It is a basic "sketchbook" in the browser that operates like a mouse-controlled Etch-a-Sketch: hovering over a square would color it in slightly and returning to the same square multiple times would make it increasingly darker.

In This project, I applied:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. DOM
5. Event handling and callback
6. Git && Github

A live demo of the project is found at https://abdelrahman-gado.github.io/etch-a-sketch/
